                            <p>Fixes for all fallout games listed below. Please read everything for your game before asking a question This post has been archived, so feel free to send me a PM if you need help We get a lot of requests for bug and crash help on /r/fallout, so point people here when they ask for help. I will remain active in the comments for people who need help. For all games, Ensure you have your Audio and Video drivers up to date! before asking for help, make sure your computer meets. I need help, I already attempted the fix by editing the ini file, but it still doesn't work. The launcher comes up just fine, but when I attempt to start the game, nothing happens at all. I have alse tried running the Fallout 3 application from my steamapps folder, and I get ann error message "Ordinal not found- The ordinal 42 could not be located in dynamic link library C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\xlive.dll. I assume this an issue with GFWL, but I tried installing the GFWL disabler through nexusmods. Just downloaded and installed Fallout 3, GOTY Edition from Steam, and it says it can't get something 42 from xlive.dll. Google says that's Games for Windows Live which has been deprecated, but installed anyway. There's a GfWL remover on the Fallout 3 Nexus site, but it won't run until Fallout 3 has been ran once and created its .ini, but Fallout 3 won't run until it can find GfWL. I believe I was able to remove GfWL from Fallout 3 in Windows 7, but I am not sure I am using I am currently running windows 8 and for some reason when ever I get to the Fallout launcher and click play it the launcher closes but nothing pops up afterwards. I've gone to the source and tried to open that but it just pops up a mini window that says "The ordinal 42 could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\xlive.dll." IF anyone has a solution that would be great. This is a copy of my Fallout Game Fix Guide that has been modified for use to be directed at /r/fo3 Click here for help with Fallout 1, 2, And New Vegas ( If your /fo3 game crashes, freezes, or does other odd things, this guide should help you. I suggest looking for your specific problem below, and using the fixes related to it before trying others. Make sure you have your Audio and Video. Just downloaded and installed from Steam, it says it can't get something 42 from xlive.dll. That's Games for Windows Live which has been deprecated, but installed anyway. There's a GfWL remover on the Fallout 3 Nexus site, but it won't run until Fallout 3 has been ran once and created its ini, but Fallout 3 won't run until it can find GfWL. I believe I was able to remove GfWL from Fallout 3 in Windows 7, but I am not sure I am using the same tool to do so. I tried running the latest version. 
Not sure whether to post this in /r/techsupport or here, so I'll just go with here. I just bought Fallout 3 a few days ago, and I knew that I'd have some issues getting the game to run on my Windows 10 machine, so I got the Updated Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch from the Nexus. However, whenever I launch Fallout 3, it brings up the launcher just fine, but when I click the Play button, it closes the launcher and nothing happens. I went into the files and ran FalloutLauncher.exe as an administrator. I'm sure you have most likely gotten this a lot but I am unable to find a solution. I recently got a physical copy of Fallout 3 GOTY edition. I installed it and whenever I try to play it I get: "The ordinal 42 could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\xlive.dll." I looked online and most of the information I found was for online copies, which had more files in their file folder than I do. I'm not sure if this is the actual issue. Any help would be great. This probably isn't the right place to post this question and will probably get downvoted into oblivion, I don't care, I just want a simple answer. I just bought Fallout 3 during the Steam Halloween Sale (.75 what a steal!) and can't wait to play it. It just wont launch. I have a Windows 8 machine, and a very good computer (i7, 16GB RAM, GTX 760). I have done my fair share of research, the only solution that I have come up with that I haven't tried is downloading some file from a foreign. I downloaded Fallout 3 off Steam. After I run it, everything seems fine until you hit "Play". After that the game closes and an error message pops up: "The ordinal 42 could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\xlive.dll." Please Okay, so last night I bought Fallout 3 off Steam, and let it download while I slept. When I woke up, I got an error message saying "The ordinal 42 could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\xlive.dll." I've already tried replacing the dll file, but that did not help. Please. </p>
